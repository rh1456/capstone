# Capstone
Elevator Pitch:
***'Doggo' helps connect dogs with similar traits in a given area, and allows the user to send and create "playdate" requests.
The app populates potential "matches" based on similarity in traits, and displays a map with "dog-friendly" locales.***

-What's the problem being solved... 
---Dog's are social/energetic beings, but it can be difficult to find a dog-friend for your pup if you're new to the area, new to your dog, limited on time...etc. Based on having similar traits, the aim is to match dogs that will likely be a good match for eachother and play well together. ---

Main functions -> 
* Maintain user profiles with stored info on the dog's traits and allows user to update a "status" on the newsfeed page. 

* Generate compatible dogs in the area from library of stored trait data, display as scrollable "cards" as header on newsfeed page. (something similar to Hero NASA API launch cards)


* create profile for new users that stores basic info of dog inlcuding 3-4 traits that will be used for matching for current members


* Main but simple newsfeed page with list of "compatible" dogs in the area and a status. Also displays API Mapbox of pinpointed dog-friendly locations (Potentially map out where current 'dates' are happening) 

locales. Each "match card" displays dog profile image and name and gives option to request playdate. Simple settings nav bar to adjust profile credentials, pic, etc. 


* Ability to create a playdate with input of, date, time, location, ..updates to list of upcoming dates

* Ability to Update and Delete playdates 





Stretch-Goals:
* Use map to set pinpoints of where dates are happening 

* Facebook-esque notifications 

* preview profile feature on the create profile page

* Confirmation emails for new profiles?

* Display the distance of a "match" -> would need to add zipcode, address, etc to profiles.
