# Capstone
Elevator Pitch:
***'Doggo' helps connect dogs with similar traits in a given area, and allows the user to send and create "playdate" requests.
The app populates potential "matches" based on similarity in traits, and displays a map with "dog-friendly" locales.***

-What's the problem being solved... Dog's are social/energetic beings, but it can be difficult to find a dog-friend for your pup if you're new to the area, new to your dog, limited on time...etc. Based on having similar traits the aim is to match dogs  that will likely be a good match for eachother and play well together. 

Main functions -> 
* Maintain user profiles with stored info on the dog's traits and allows user to update a "status" on the newsfeed page. 

* Generate compatible dogs in the are from library of stored trait data, display as scrollable "cards" as header on newsfeed page. 


* create profile  for new users that stores basic info of dog inlcuding 3-4 traits that will be used to match/Login feature for current members

* Send a "friend" or match request to another profile through the given dog's profile page/Ability to accept request

* Main but simple newsfeed page with list of current matches and a status. Also displays API Mapbox of pinpointed dog-friendly 
locales. Each "match card" displays dog profile image and name and gives option to request playdate. Simple settings nav bar to adjust profile credentials, pic, etc. 


* Function to send playdate request with input of, date, time, location, ability to accept/reject..updates to list of upcoming dates.


Stretch-Goals:
* preview profile feature on the create profile page

* List of previous play dates

* Confirmation emails for new profiles?

* Display the distance of a "match" -> would need to add zipcode, address, etc to profiles.
